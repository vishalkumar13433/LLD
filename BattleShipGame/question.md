BattleShip Game
Design and implement a battleship game to be played between two players until one comes out as the winner.
Requirements:
● The game will be played in a square area of the sea with NxN grids which will be called a battlefield. “N” should be taken as input in your code.
● The battlefield will be divided in half between both the players. So in a NxN battlefield, NxN/2 grids will belong to PlayerA and the other NxN/2 grids will belong to playerB
● The size and location of each ship will be taken as input. Each ship will be assumed to be of Square shape. Both the players should be assigned equal fleet.
● The location of each ship in the NxN grids has to be taken as input (X, Y). X and Y should be integers. For eg. if a ship “SH1” is at (2, 2) and has the size of 4, its corners will be at (0, 0), (0, 4), (4, 0) and (4,4)
● Ships will remain stationary. No two ships should overlap with each other. However they can touch boundaries with each other.
● Each player will fire one missile towards the enemy field during his turn using the “random coordinate fire” strategy, which means the missile will hit at a random coordinate of the opponent’s field. It might hit or miss the opponent ship. In either case the turn is then transferred to the other player.
    ○   In case of a hit, the opponent’s ship is destroyed.
    ○   In case of a miss, nothing happens.
● No two missiles should ever be fired at the same coordinates throughout the course
of the game.
● When all the ships of a particular player has been destroyed, he loses the game.
The following APIs have to be implemented:
Mandatory:
● initGame(N)
This will initialize the game with a battlefield of size NxN. Where the left half of N/2xN will be assigned to PlayerA and the right half will be assigned to PlayerB
● addShip(id, size, x position PlayerA, y position PlayerA, x position PlayerB, y position PlayerB)
This will add a ship of given size at the given coordinates in both the player’s
fleet.
● startGame()

This will begin the game, where PlayerA will always take the first turn. The output of each step should be printed clearly in the console.
For eg.
PlayerA’s turn: Missile fired at (2, 4). “Hit”. PlayerB’s ship with id “SH1” destroyed.
PlayerB’s turn: Missile fired at (6, 1). “Miss”
Optional
● viewBattleField()
This will display the battlefield as a NxN grid and all the ships along with the grids occupied by each ship. PlayerA’s ship with id SH1 will be marked as A-SH1, with id SH2 as A-SH2 and so on. Whereas PlayerB’s ships will be marked as B-SH1, B-SH2 and so on.
Note: It should mark all the grids occupied by a ship and not just the center coordinate.
Guidelines:
● You should store the data in-memory using a language-specific data-structure.
● You can print the output in the console.
● Design your application in a way that a new fire strategy can be implemented and used
instead of the default one (random coordinate).
● Implement clear separation between your data layers and service layers.
Expectations:
● Your code should cover all the mandatory functionalities explained above.
● Your code should be executable and clean.
● Your code should be properly refactored, and exceptions should be gracefully handled.
● Appropriate errors should be displayed on console when user input violates the rules of
the game.
How will you be evaluated?

Code Should be working
Code readability and testability Separation Of Concerns Abstraction
Object-Oriented concepts. Language proficiency.
Scalability

● Test Coverage (Bonus Points)
Sample Execution:
initGame(6)

addShip(“SH1”, size = 2, 1, 5, 4, 4) >> viewBattleField() // coordinates are incorrect


>> startGame()
PlayerA’s turn: Missile fired at (3, 0) : “Miss” : Ships
Remaining - PlayerA:1, PlayerB:1
PlayerB’s turn: Missile fired at (1, 1) : “Miss” : Ships
Remaining - PlayerA:1, PlayerB:1
PlayerA’s turn: Missile fired at (5, 3) : “Hit” B-SH2 destroyed
: Ships Remaining - PlayerA:1, PlayerB:0 GameOver. PlayerA wins.
